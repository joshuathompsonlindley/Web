			<h1>Lecturate</h1>
			<p>Lecturate is an application that allows students to give feedback on university lectures, directly to lecturers.</p>
			<p>The project took place over the course of 6 months, with a <a href="files/lecturate.pdf">full paper</a> and poster presentation detailing the results of research, designs, development, and testing.</p>
			<p>At the end of the project, 3 code deliverables were produced:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A C# API and MySQL Database (named Fuse)</li>
				<li>A C# Web Application for Lecturers (name Spark)</li>
				<li>A Java Android Application for Students (named Neon)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Overall, I was awarded a grade of 71 for report, poster and code.</p>
