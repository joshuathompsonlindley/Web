			<h1>Arpelle</h1>
            <p>Arpelle is a toy compiler and scripting language that is very much a work in progress. It produces C++ code. This was my summer project because I was unemployed and I wanted to learn about compilers.</p>
            <p>Concepts are based off the TeenyTinyCompiler by <a href="https://github.com/AZHenley">@AZHenley</a>, built in .NET 5 and C# instead of Python, and with a modified language.</p>
            <p>The language is BASIC like, kinda Python like.</p>
            <p>Here's an incredibly simply program I use to test the features I've implemented so far.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
Set a As Number = 0
Set b As Number = 1
Set hello As String = "Hello World"
Set flag As Boolean = True

If flag == True Then
    Printout hello
    Set a = 1
    Set b = 2
    Input hello
Else
    Printout "Not Hello World!"
End

While flag == True Repeat
    Printout hello
    Printout a
    Printout b
End
                </code>
            </pre>
            
            <p><a href="https://github.com/joshuathompsonlindley/Arpelle">It is currently Open Source and available on my GitHub.</a></p></p>
